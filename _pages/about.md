I'm a Third year undergraduate student from [Xi'an jiaotong university](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/),majoring in Statistic and minoring in Financial engineering and I'm an outstanding student and excellent league member in XJTU. My interested research focus on Inversion Problem with Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Geophysics and so on. The key words about my researches are: Inversion Problem, Full Waveform Inversion, Implicit Neural Networks, Physics-informed Neural Networks, Neural Operator, Low-Rank Tensor Function Decomposition.
